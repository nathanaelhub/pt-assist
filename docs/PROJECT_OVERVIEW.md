# AI Physical Therapy Assistant - Project Overview

## Executive Summary

The **AI Physical Therapy Assistant** is a computer vision application that uses YOLO11 pose estimation to monitor and provide feedback on physical therapy exercises. This project demonstrates real-world AI applications in healthcare, combining deep learning with biomechanical analysis to create an intelligent exercise monitoring system.

**Key Technologies:** YOLO11 Pose Estimation, OpenCV, Python, Streamlit

**Primary Use Cases:**
- Home-based PT exercise monitoring
- Telehealth physical therapy sessions
- Clinical PT documentation and progress tracking
- Patient self-service exercise programs

---

## Project Significance

### The Healthcare Challenge

Physical therapy effectiveness depends heavily on:
1. **Correct exercise form** - Poor form can cause injury or slow recovery
2. **Consistent practice** - Patients often struggle with home exercise compliance
3. **Progress tracking** - Therapists need objective measurements over time
4. **Accessibility** - Not all patients can attend frequent in-person sessions

### How AI Solves This

This project leverages **YOLO11 pose estimation** to:
- Detect 17 body keypoints in real-time
- Calculate joint angles mathematically
- Compare movement to clinically-appropriate ranges
- Provide immediate, actionable feedback
- Track progress automatically across sessions

### Real-World Applications

| Setting | Application |
|---------|-------------|
| **Home PT** | Patient performs exercises with webcam guidance |
| **Telehealth** | Therapist monitors patient remotely via video |
| **Clinics** | Automated rep counting and form documentation |
| **Research** | Objective movement analysis for studies |

## How to Understand the Code

### Recommended Reading Order

**For beginners (understanding the concepts):**
1. `config.yaml` - See how exercises are defined
2. `src/utils.py` - Learn angle calculation math
3. `analyze.py` - Follow the main processing flow
4. `interfaces/app.py` - See the user-facing application

**For developers (extending the code):**
1. `analyze.py:ExerciseTracker` - Understand the state machine
2. `src/form_assessment.py:FormAnalyzer` - See form checking logic
3. `config.yaml` - Add new exercises
4. `src/session_tracker.py` - Understand data persistence

### Key Concepts

#### 1. Pose Estimation
YOLO11 detects 17 body keypoints per person in each frame:
```
0: Nose      5-6: Shoulders    11-12: Hips
1-2: Eyes    7-8: Elbows       13-14: Knees
3-4: Ears    9-10: Wrists      15-16: Ankles
```

#### 2. Angle Calculation
Joint angles are calculated using vector mathematics:
```python
def calculate_angle(point1, vertex, point2):
    vector1 = point1 - vertex
    vector2 = point2 - vertex
    cos_angle = dot(vector1, vector2) / (|vector1| * |vector2|)
    return degrees(arccos(cos_angle))
```

#### 3. Rep Counting State Machine
```
       angle >= up_threshold
  DOWN ────────────────────> UP
    ^                         │
    │   angle <= down_threshold
    └─────────────────────────┘
         (rep counted here)
```

#### 4. Form Assessment
Form score = 40% ROM achievement + 30% smoothness + 30% symmetry
